# 🤟 American Sign Language (ASL) Recognition System

A **real-time American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognition system** built using **MediaPipe hand landmarks** and **Deep Learning**.
The system captures hand gestures via webcam, extracts 3D landmark features, trains a neural network model, and predicts ASL alphabets in real time.

---

## 📌 Description

Communication between hearing-impaired individuals and non-signers can be challenging.
This project aims to reduce that gap by providing an **automated ASL recognition system** using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

Instead of using raw images, the system leverages **hand landmark-based features**, making it lightweight, efficient, and suitable for real-time execution.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Hand Gesture Capture**

   * Webcam captures live video input.
2. **Hand Landmark Detection**

   * MediaPipe detects 21 hand landmarks.
3. **Feature Extraction**

   * Each landmark provides (x, y, z) coordinates → 63 features.
4. **Model Training**

   * A neural network is trained using landmark features.
5. **Real-time Prediction**

   * The trained model predicts ASL alphabets live on screen.
